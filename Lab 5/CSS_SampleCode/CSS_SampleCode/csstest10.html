		The pineapple[2][3] (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit 
		and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.[4] 
		The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries.
		The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. 
		Since the 1820s,pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.

	<div class="style2">
		Further, it is the third most important tropical fruit in world production. In the 20th century, 
		Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, especially for the US; however, by 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, 
		and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.[5]

	<div class="style3 specialpara">
		Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit.
		The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit,[2][6] or from a side shoot,
		and typically mature within a year.[6][7]
	</div>
	<div class="style4">
		The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5 m (3.3 to 4.9 ft) tall, although sometimes it can be taller. 
		In appearance, the plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves. When creating its fruit, it usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this. 
		Once it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit. After the first fruit is produced, side shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) 
		are produced in the leaf axils of the main stem.
