			The pineapple[2][3] (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit 
			and the most economically significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae.[4] 
			The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has been cultivated for many centuries.
			The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. 
			Since the 1820s,pineapple has been commercially grown in greenhouses and many tropical plantations.
		</div>
		<div id="column2">
			Further, it is the third most important tropical fruit in world production. In the 20th century, 
			Hawaii was a dominant producer of pineapples, especially for the US; however, by 2016, Costa Rica, Brazil, 
			and the Philippines accounted for nearly one-third of the world's production of pineapples.[5]
		</div>
		<div id="column3">
			Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple fruit.
			The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit,[2][6] or from a side shoot,
			and typically mature within a year.[6][7]
